This is the generic setup for any chess program future me might want to make.

Chess is fun. And there are cool API's and tons of funny CS stuff to do with them.

And about once every 3 months I have a sudden urge to make a chess project of some sort.

But each time I look at my previous chess code and realize how painful it will be to untangle the simple chess UI from the mountains of spaghetti code I added on top of it to create whatever esoteric functionality I had wanted for that program and then I notice one tiny flaw with the board and decide "eh at this point I might as well just recode all of it"

But that's painful. And I don't want to do it anymore. So It ends now. This is a chess template. It is finished. It can be used for whatever. Please dear god let me never have to write a python chess UI again. :-)
